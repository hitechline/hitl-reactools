# Disabling Logger

If you are not satisfied with the noisy logs that library emit, or wish to not receive logs in production, follow the steps below.

<br />
<br />

> Remember: Disabling the logs you may lose unresolved points in your application/project, that probably will cause a reproduction not expected.

<br />

- The library has integrated support to disable this system.

## Disabling in Production

<br />

1. Import the object **logger**.
2. Next, call the method **disable()** that belongs to the **logger**.

```tsx
import { logger } from '@hitechline/reactools';

// Application main

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  logger.disable();
}
```

<br />

## Disabled by default

<br />

```tsx
import { logger } from '@hitechline/reactools';

// Application main

logger.disable();
```
